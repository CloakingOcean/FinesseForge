Custom animation demonstration for Spark Squared

## About This Project
This elegant animation demo got my foot in the door with SparkSquared and eventually led to a Content Developer position!
I greatly appreciate my time at SparkSquared as it allowed me to explore what possibilities existed with the Minecraft
technologies we were working with and taught me some valuable lessons about communication and debugging practices! 
I look forward to future opportunities with the acquired desire and knowledge left to me by SparkSquared!

## Built With
* [Maven (Build Tool)]
* [Spigot API]

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
This project utilizes the Maven build automation tool. After [installing] Maven, use the command `mvn clean install` in the
main project to download all of the required dependencies for this project. Currently, this project only depends on `spigot-api` 
version `1.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

Once all the dependencies are downloaded, use the command `mvn clean package` to create a `/target` folder containing the exported
plugin.

In order to run this [`Spigot Plugin`], you need a [Bukkit]/[Spigot] Server with a version around `1.8.8`.

Just stick the FinessForge.jar into the plugins folder of the server.

## Usage

Once you have everything running, simply join the server, and right-click an ender chest. The animation will play immediately
on top of whichever ender chest you clicked.
